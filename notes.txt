Hypothetically, the regex I set up in the response integration will automatically scan any exceptions thrown,
and look through their messages. If they see a matching regex they will respond with the proper status code.

If you want to force a request to look a certain way, then you need to create a model that accurately shows
what the request body will look like. Upon making the model, go to the method's Method Request, and set request
validator to validate the message body. If the message body doesn't match what is expected, then it will return
with a 400 error code.
